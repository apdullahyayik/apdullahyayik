### Hi I'm Apdullah ðŸ‘‹


<div align="center">
 
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m AI Researcher at Huawei Turkey R&D Center.

ðŸ’¬ You can ask me about linear algebra, NLP, Recommendation Systems (this is current interest) and optimization techniques.
 
âš¡ Fun fact: I also love biomedical signal processing.

:pushpin: Tr-Tokenizer and TrTopicter projects are now available at Pypi (pip install trtokenizer & pip install trtopicter)

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™ve recently worked on topic classification task for the Turkish Language with the usage of BERT and BERTurk [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/196wEPGPzEqQW8wQY2zUvhH_AWrOTxred?authuser=1)



ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently exploring superoities of 
      <ul>
        <li>Deep Neural Recommendation Systems,</li>
       <li>Attention over convolution and reccurence,</li>
       <li>Word embeddings with WordPiece algorithm over neural ones such as CBOV and Skip-Gram</li>
     </ul>
